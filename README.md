## Here Otus9051 posts every single little thing he codes! Updates every Saturday!
### Also please don't ask for any software or any bug fixes or contiribute to this, you can however fork this and do whatever tf you want to do but dont do anything here as I want this thing as stock as possible. This is fully public domain.

P.S. I use ```using namespace std``` in my CPP codes as I think its fine. I am not using a thousand libs anyway.
